# The Problem
Every new slack and discord community doesn't have my preferred expressive range because key emojiis haven't
been installed yet.

# The Solution
Keep this repo up to date then install it in one fell upload. 

# Style Guide
Discord replaces dashes (`-`) in filenames with (``), so don't use dashes in filenames, use underscores or mashcase - it's probably best to use whichever of those two slackmojis uses.
